### This repo contains a variety of Python modules covering a range of tools offered by the Python programming language like lambda functions, exception handling, module usage, conditional expressions, list comprehension, FileIO, bitwise logic, and more. A lot of this code is intentionally written poorly to illustrate resulting errors and should in no way be interpreted as an example of my skills as a Python programmer.
